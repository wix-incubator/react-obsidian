title: "Migrate to v3.x"
---

Migrating from v2.x to v3.x is a straightforward process. This guide will help you migrate your existing codebase to the latest version of Obsidian.

## Breaking changes
1. **Minimum supported version of TypeScript is now v5.0.0.** If you are using an older version of TypeScript, you will need to upgrade to v5.0.0 or later.
2. **Legacy decorators are no longer supported.** Starting from v3.x, Obsidian uses the stage 3 decorators proposal which is enabled by default in TypeScript v5.0.0. To use the new decorators proposal, you will need to remove the `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` options from your `tsconfig.json` file:

```js title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Removed lines start
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
    // Removed lines end
  }
}
```

Additionally, update your Babel configurations file to use the new decorators proposal:

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
// Add this line
    ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', {version: '2023-11'}], 
    // Remove this line
    ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', {legacy: true}],
  ]
};
```

## Deprecations
With the release of v3.x, we're aligning our API with the community standards. All decorators that were previously capitalized are now camel-cased. For example, the `@Graph` decorator is now `@graph` and the `@LifecycleBound` decorator is now `@lifecycleBound`.

The capitalized decorators will continue to work in v3.x, but they will be removed in the next major release. We recommend updating your codebase to use the camel-cased decorators to avoid any breaking changes in the future.
